**Youtube Web Downloader** is a simple Javascript applications that use YoutubeInMp3 API.
I just made it for fun, but _new features will comming soon_ :)

## Instructions
Before use it, read the little documentation on the website.

- Paste a link of a youtube video
- Click on "Add to list"
- Verify your list
- Click to "download"
- And enjoy (^.^)

**Use the right URL !**

Sometimes it will redirect you to the API website, it's an bug but that happen sometimes, I don't know yet why it's here, but no worry, you still can download your tracks by clicking on "download song" ;)

#### Can I contribute ?
Sure my friend, you are welcome if you have a new ideas, or if you want correct my code :)
Let's do it !
